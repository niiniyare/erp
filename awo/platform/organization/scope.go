package organization

// VisibilityMode controls which organization nodes are included when
// OrganizationService.ResolveScope resolves the set visible to a viewer.
//
// # Two-stage isolation model
//
// VisibilityMode operates entirely in the application layer (Stage 2).
// Tenant isolation (Stage 1) is handled by PostgreSQL RLS and is never
// affected by VisibilityMode. The two stages are orthogonal:
//
//   Stage 1: RLS fires on every DB query — tenant_id = current_tenant_id().
//            This prevents cross-tenant leaks. VisibilityMode plays no role.
//
//   Stage 2: ResolveScope(viewer) → []uuid.UUID of visible org IDs.
//            Application service appends org_id IN (…) to the filter.
//            Repositories receive only typed filter predicates.
//
// Repositories are organization-agnostic. They never compute visibility.
// They receive the resolved filter and execute queries inside the tenant
// RLS context. Both isolation stages fire independently.
//
// # Canonical request pipeline
//
//   Request
//     → Authentication (session validation)
//     → ViewerContext (load org assignments, roles)
//     → OrganizationService.ResolveScope()   ← Stage 2
//     → Append org filter to query predicates
//     → Repository.Query()
//     → Tenant RLS fires                     ← Stage 1
//     → Database

	// to via platform_org_assignment, regardless of tree position.
	// Typical use: HR business partner assigned to multiple unrelated departments.

	// Typical use: matrix organizations; project-team cross-org access.
