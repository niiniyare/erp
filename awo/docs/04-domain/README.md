# Domain Layer

**Section 04 | Domain Layer**

The Domain Layer is the stateless core of every module. It contains declarations and logic that define what entities are, how they behave, who may access them, and what happens as they move through their lifecycle.

Domain Layer code has zero external dependencies — it imports only `awo/def/`, `awo/filter/`, and the Go standard library. This property enables the entire domain layer to be tested without running infrastructure.
