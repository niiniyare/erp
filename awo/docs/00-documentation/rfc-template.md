# RFC Template

An RFC (Request for Comments) is used to propose changes to FROZEN documents or significant architectural changes that are not yet ready to become ADRs. Copy this template when writing a new RFC.

---

## When to Write an RFC vs. an ADR

| RFC | ADR |
|---|---|
| Proposing a change (not yet decided) | Recording a decision (already made) |
| Seeking feedback on trade-offs | Documenting the chosen option and rationale |
| Changing a FROZEN document | Capturing why an option was rejected |
| Significant feature addition | Architectural decision with lasting consequences |

An RFC may result in an ADR once the RFC achieves consensus and the decision is made.

## RFC Lifecycle

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `draft` | Being written; not open for comment yet |
| `open` | Open for comment (7-day minimum comment period) |
| `accepted` | Architecture team voted to accept |
| `rejected` | Architecture team voted to reject |
| `withdrawn` | Author withdrew before vote |

RFCs that are accepted SHOULD result in a corresponding ADR recording the decision. RFCs that are rejected are retained as historical record — do not delete.
