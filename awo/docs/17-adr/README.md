# Architecture Decision Records

**Section 17 | Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)**

Architecture Decision Records capture the reasoning behind significant decisions in Awo's design. Each ADR documents: the context, the decision, the consequences (positive and negative), and alternatives that were considered and rejected.

ADRs are immutable once accepted — they record history. If a decision is reversed, a new ADR is written superseding the original.

## How to Write a New ADR

See the [ADR Template](../00-documentation/adr-template.md) for the required format. ADRs are proposed as pull requests and accepted only after architecture review. An accepted ADR may be superseded but never deleted.
