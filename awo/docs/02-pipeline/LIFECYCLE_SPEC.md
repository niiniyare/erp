# Entity Lifecycle Specification

**Classification:** Specification — Tier 0
**Owner:** `02-pipeline/LIFECYCLE_SPEC.md`
**Status:** Frozen at v1.0
**Package:** `awo.so/awo/runtime`

## Purpose

This document specifies the complete ordered pipeline that executes for every entity mutation (Create, Update, Delete). It defines: the stages, what runs at each stage, the transaction boundary, what errors abort which stages, and the invariants the runtime guarantees.

## Scope

This specification covers the runtime pipeline for Create, Update, and Delete mutations. Read operations (Get, Query, Count, Exists) are not pipelined — they pass through authentication and authorization middleware and execute a filtered query.

## Dependencies

- [`01-entity/ENTITY_DEFINITION_SPEC.md`](../01-entity/ENTITY_DEFINITION_SPEC.md) — EntityDefinition and HookSet
- [`02-pipeline/ERROR_MODEL.md`](ERROR_MODEL.md) — ValidationError, BusinessError
- [`03-auth/AUTHORIZATION_SPEC.md`](../03-auth/AUTHORIZATION_SPEC.md) — PolicyEvaluator
- [`12-audit/AUDIT_SPEC.md`](../12-audit/AUDIT_SPEC.md) — AuditRecord pipeline stage

---

## 1. Pipeline Stages

The following sequence is executed for every mutation. Stages are ordered and non-configurable.

## 2. Stage Specifications

### ASSEMBLE

**What runs:** The runtime constructs an `EntityRecord` from the HTTP request body JSON.
- Field values are decoded and coerced to their `FieldType` Go types.
- Default values (`FieldDef.Default`) are applied for absent fields.
- `EntityRecord.Meta.Actor` is set from the `ViewerContext`.
- `EntityRecord.Meta.OperationType` is set to `Create`, `Update`, or `Delete`.
- For Update: the current record is fetched and merged with the patch.
- `EntityRecord.ID` is set from the URL parameter (Update/Delete) or generated as UUIDv7 (Create).

**Failure:** Assembly failure (malformed JSON, unknown field) returns HTTP 400 before any hooks run.

---

### before_validate

**What runs:** `HookSet.BeforeCreate` / `HookSet.BeforeUpdate` / `HookSet.BeforeDelete` hooks, in declaration order.

**Transaction state:** Outside TX.

**Abort via:** Return `*def.ValidationError` from any hook. The runtime stops at the first error and returns HTTP 422. Remaining hooks in the slice do not run.

**Purpose:** Field transformation before validation. Example: normalizing phone number format, deriving a field value from another field.

**Prohibition:** Do not perform database writes in `before_validate` hooks. The TX has not started. Database reads are permitted.

---

### VALIDATE

**What runs:** Built-in framework validation:
1. Required field check — returns `ValidationError` for each missing required field.
2. Type coercion validation — ensures each field value matches its `FieldType`.
3. Immutable field check (Update only) — returns `ValidationError` if any `Immutable: true` field differs from the stored value.
4. Length and range checks — `MaxLen`, `Min`, `Max`.
5. Custom field validators — `FieldDef.Validators`, called in declaration order.
6. Select option validation — rejects values not in `FieldDef.Options`.

**Transaction state:** Outside TX.

**Abort via:** Any validation failure returns HTTP 422 with a `ValidationError` containing field-level messages.

**Atomicity:** All validation errors are collected before returning. A response may contain multiple field errors.

---

### AUTHORIZE

**What runs:** `PolicyEvaluator.CanPerform(ctx, viewer, qualifiedEntityName, action)`.

`action` is one of: `"create"`, `"read"`, `"write"`, `"delete"`, or a custom action name.

**Platform admin bypass:** If `viewer.IsPlatformAdmin()` returns `true`, this stage is skipped entirely.

**Transaction state:** Outside TX.

**Abort via:** `CanPerform` returns `(false, nil)` → HTTP 403. `CanPerform` returns `(_, error)` → HTTP 500.

---

### before_save

**What runs:** `HookSet.BeforeCreate` / `HookSet.BeforeUpdate` / `HookSet.BeforeDelete` hooks, in declaration order.

**Transaction state:** Outside TX.

**Abort via:** Return `*def.BusinessError` from any hook. The runtime stops at the first error and returns HTTP 400 (or the status code in `BusinessError.Status`). Remaining hooks do not run.

**Purpose:** Business rule validation that requires database access. Example: checking a customer's credit limit before allowing invoice creation, validating inventory availability.

**Distinction from before_validate:** `before_validate` is for field transformation and simple validation. `before_save` is for domain rule enforcement that may require data access.

---

### PERSIST

**What runs:** The entity driver writes the record to PostgreSQL.
- Create: `INSERT INTO {table_name} (...) VALUES (...) RETURNING *`
- Update: `UPDATE {table_name} SET ... WHERE id = $1 AND tenant_id = current_tenant_id()`
- Delete: `DELETE FROM {table_name} WHERE id = $1 AND tenant_id = current_tenant_id()`

**Transaction state:** Inside TX.

**Failure:** PostgreSQL errors are mapped to domain errors by `parseDBError()`. Constraint violations (unique, check) produce `BusinessError`. Other errors produce an internal error.

---

### AUDIT RECORD

**What runs:** The runtime writes an `AuditRecord` to the `audit_log` table within the same transaction.

**AuditRecord contains:**
- `entity_name` — qualified name of the entity
- `record_id` — UUID of the affected record
- `tenant_id` — owning tenant
- `actor_id` — user ID or service account ID from `ViewerContext`
- `operation` — `"create"`, `"update"`, or `"delete"`
- `occurred_at` — current timestamp within the TX
- `before` — snapshot of field values before the operation (Update/Delete only)
- `after` — snapshot of field values after the operation (Create/Update only)

**Skip condition:** Skipped if `EntityDefinition.AuditEnabled` is `false`.

**Sensitive field handling:** Fields with `Sensitive: true` are excluded from the `before` and `after` snapshots.

**Transaction state:** Inside TX. If this write fails, the TX rolls back.

---

### after_save

**What runs:** `HookSet.AfterCreate` / `HookSet.AfterUpdate` / `HookSet.AfterDelete` hooks, in declaration order.

**Transaction state:** Inside TX.

**Abort via:** Return any error from any hook → TX rolls back → HTTP 500 (or appropriate status).

**Critical constraint:** Since `after_save` runs inside the TX, any error causes the entire mutation to roll back, including the PERSIST and AUDIT RECORD stages.

**Purpose:** Post-persist side effects that MUST be atomic with the mutation. Examples:
- Writing journal entries when an invoice is created (double-entry constraint)
- Updating an aggregate counter in a related record
- Assigning naming series values

**Prohibition:** Do not perform slow or unreliable operations (HTTP calls, file writes) in `after_save`. The TX is open and PostgreSQL holds locks. Slow `after_save` hooks cause lock contention.

---

### Workflow Start (Post-Commit)

**What runs:** For each matching `WorkflowTrigger` on the entity, the runtime writes a record to the `workflow_outbox` table. A separate goroutine (the outbox worker) reads pending records and dispatches to Temporal with exponential backoff retry.

**Transaction state:** OUTSIDE TX. The workflow dispatch is decoupled from the mutation transaction.

**Guaranteed semantics:** If the entity TX committed, the workflow outbox record exists. The outbox worker MUST eventually dispatch the workflow. "At least once" delivery — the workflow MUST be idempotent.

**Failure handling:** If Temporal is unreachable, the record remains in the outbox with `status = 'pending'`. The outbox worker retries with backoff: 1s, 2s, 4s, 8s, up to 5 minutes, for up to 24 hours. After 24 hours, the record is marked `status = 'failed'` and an alert is raised.

See [`08-workflow/OUTBOX_SPEC.md`](../08-workflow/OUTBOX_SPEC.md).

---

## 3. Transaction Boundary and Ownership

**Transaction ownership (ADR-013):** The driver implementation (`contrib/pgx`) owns and manages all database transactions. The pipeline is stateless with respect to transactions — it does not open, commit, or roll back transactions.

The driver's internal execution sequence:

```
driver.Create(ctx, input):
  1. [TX begins]
  2. Executes PERSIST (SQL INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE)
  3. Calls pipeline.RunAuditRecord(ctx, record)     ← inside TX
  4. Calls pipeline.RunAfterCreate(ctx, record)      ← inside TX
  5. [TX commits] if all succeed
  6. [TX rolls back] if any step 2–4 returns error
```

The `context.Context` carries the active transaction connection. Any database operation inside `RunAuditRecord` or `RunAfterCreate` that uses the context-carried connection participates in the same transaction automatically.

The transaction boundary from the pipeline stage perspective:

```
TX begins: inside driver.Create/Update/Delete, before PERSIST
TX commits: after after_save completes without error
TX rolls back: when PERSIST, AUDIT RECORD, or after_save returns an error
```

**Consequence for wrappers:** A wrapper implementing `driver.EntityRepository[T]` that calls the inner driver's `Create()` and then performs additional writes would execute those writes OUTSIDE the committed transaction. The repository wrapper pattern MUST NOT be used for any operation that requires atomicity with the entity mutation (e.g., audit writing). See ADR-013 and ADR-014.

Hooks that run before `before_save` (inclusive) MUST NOT assume a TX is open.
Hooks that run from PERSIST onwards (AUDIT RECORD, after_save) run inside the driver-managed TX.

---

## 4. Hook Recursion Policy (ADR-010)

The pipeline runtime maintains a per-goroutine entity name stack via `context.WithValue`. If a hook on entity `A` triggers a Create/Update/Delete on entity `A` through any code path, the runtime detects the recursion and panics:

```
PANIC: hook recursion detected: finance_journal_entry hook triggered Create on finance_journal_entry
Context stack: [finance_invoice → finance_journal_entry → finance_journal_entry]
```

Cross-entity operations from hooks are explicitly allowed. A hook on `finance_invoice` MAY call Create on `finance_journal_entry`. A hook on `finance_journal_entry` MUST NOT call Create on `finance_journal_entry`.

This panic is intentional and catches programming errors at development time.

---

## 5. Error Propagation

| Stage | Abort Error Type | HTTP Status |
|-------|-----------------|------------|
| ASSEMBLE | (parse error) | 400 |
| before_validate | `*ValidationError` | 422 |
| VALIDATE | `*ValidationError` | 422 |
| AUTHORIZE | (deny) | 403 |
| before_save | `*BusinessError` | Per status field |
| PERSIST | (constraint violation → `*BusinessError`) | 409 / 400 |
| AUDIT RECORD | (write failure) | 500 + rollback |
| after_save | (any error) | 500 + rollback |
| Workflow start | (none — async, outbox handles retry) | N/A |

---

## 6. Normative Requirements

- The pipeline MUST execute stages in the exact order specified above.
- The TX MUST begin before PERSIST and MUST commit after after_save.
- The AUDIT RECORD stage MUST execute within the TX.
- Workflow starts MUST execute outside the TX, after the TX commits.
- Hook recursion on the same entity MUST cause a runtime panic.
- The AUTHORIZE stage MUST NOT be skipped except for platform admin actors.
- The before_validate stage MUST NOT have an open TX.
- All validation errors MUST be collected before returning (not fail-on-first).
