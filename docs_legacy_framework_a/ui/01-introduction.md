## 1.1 What Is AwoERP?

AwoERP is a **multi-tenant Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) platform** designed for organizations that operate across diverse business functions — finance, procurement, inventory, human resources, and sales — within a unified, cloud-native system.

At its technical core, AwoERP is distinguished not by what it does as a business application, but by **how it builds and delivers its user interface**. Rather than maintaining separate frontend codebases for web, iOS, and Android, AwoERP uses a **Server-Driven UI (SDUI)** architecture in which the backend is the single, authoritative source that defines what users see, how they interact with the application, and what they are permitted to do.

The user interface is not written by frontend engineers as static component trees or hard-coded screens. Instead, the backend composes the UI as a structured, typed data payload — a JSON document that describes the complete visual and behavioral contract of every screen, form, dashboard, and workflow. Mobile and web applications receive this payload and act as **rendering engines**: sophisticated, capable clients whose job is to faithfully materialize whatever the backend describes.

This architecture is not novel in isolation. It draws from a lineage of industry approaches — Meta's SDUI for Facebook's news feed, Airbnb's Ghost Platform, Shopify's Polaris, and enterprise low-code platforms such as AMIS, Retool, Appsmith, and Microsoft PowerApps. What AwoERP contributes is the application of these principles **at the domain depth required by enterprise ERP**: multi-currency ledgers, approval workflows, fine-grained authorization, multi-tenant customization, and offline-capable field operations — all driven from a single, coherent, server-owned UI description.

## 1.2 The Problem This Platform Solves

### 1.2.1 Traditional ERP UI Fragmentation

Enterprise software has historically suffered from a structural mismatch between its business complexity and its frontend delivery model. Most ERP systems — both legacy monoliths and modern SaaS platforms — maintain distinct frontend codebases for each platform they support.

The consequences are predictable and severe:

**Drift between platforms.** A form field added to the web application is not automatically available on mobile. A validation rule tightened after a compliance audit must be re-implemented in three separate codebases. A layout change approved by the design team must be coordinated across web, iOS, and Android sprint cycles. Over months and years, the platforms diverge. Users switching between web and mobile encounter different field arrangements, different error messages, and occasionally different business behaviors.

**Duplicate business logic.** Authorization rules, validation logic, and workflow state machines are implemented once in the backend — and then re-implemented, imperfectly, in each frontend. The frontend implementations are approximations. They exist for responsiveness and user experience, but they are ultimately redundant copies of truth that lives elsewhere. Every copy is a liability: it can contradict the source, it can be forgotten when the source changes, and it must be maintained indefinitely.

**Release coupling.** When a business rule changes — a new mandatory approval step, a restructured GL account hierarchy, a regulatory reporting requirement — the backend can be updated in a single deployment. But that change cannot reach users until each frontend application is updated and re-released. On mobile, this includes the additional friction of app store review cycles. The business is blocked by the tooling.

**Tenant customization through code.** When enterprise customers require customizations — a field renamed for their industry terminology, a section hidden because their workflow does not use it, a custom field added to capture data specific to their operations — the only mechanism available in most ERP systems is a code fork, a plugin with privileged access to internals, or an expensive professional services engagement. None of these scale to hundreds of tenants with unique requirements.

### 1.2.2 The Multi-Platform Maintenance Burden

Building and maintaining UI across three platforms (web, iOS, Android) with dedicated engineering teams is expensive. More importantly, it introduces **structural latency** between business intent and user experience. Every new ERP module, every workflow enhancement, every regulatory adaptation requires parallel frontend work before it is visible to users.

The industry response to this problem — cross-platform frameworks such as React Native and Flutter — reduces the platform count but does not address the root cause. The business logic that determines what a user should see and what they are permitted to do still lives in the backend. The frontend still re-implements it, now in a shared language rather than three separate ones.

AwoERP's response is more fundamental: **move the UI description itself to the backend**, and reduce the frontend to the minimum viable intelligence required to render what it is told.

### 1.2.3 Tenant Customization Without Code Forks

A multi-tenant ERP platform serves customers with genuinely different requirements. A manufacturing company and a logistics firm both need purchase order management, but their form layouts, mandatory fields, approval hierarchies, and integration touch points differ substantially. A regional subsidiary of a global enterprise operates in a different language, a different currency, and under different regulatory constraints than its parent.

Serving this diversity through code forks creates an unmaintainable combinatorial explosion. Serving it through rigid configuration tables limits customization to whatever the platform designers anticipated. Neither approach is adequate.

AwoERP addresses tenant customization through the UI platform itself. Because the backend composes and compiles UI definitions dynamically — resolving tenant context, user permissions, and feature flags at request time — **different tenants receive different UI experiences from the same underlying business logic**, without any code duplication. The customization layer is a first-class architectural concern, not an afterthought bolted onto a single-tenant design.

---

## 1.3 Platform Mission Statement

> **AwoERP's UI platform exists to ensure that every user, on every device, in every tenant, always experiences a UI that is consistent with the business rules, permissions, and configurations that govern their context — with no frontend code required to enforce or maintain that consistency.**

This mission has three practical implications:

**For engineers:** The backend is where UI intent is expressed. Frontend engineering is the craft of building capable, faithful rendering engines — not the craft of re-encoding business decisions that already exist elsewhere.

**For product and implementation teams:** Adding a new screen, modifying a workflow form, or customizing a tenant's experience is a backend and configuration concern. It does not require a frontend sprint, a mobile release, or a cross-team coordination cycle.

**For enterprise customers:** Customizations are first-class, version-controlled, and isolated to their tenant. Their instance of AwoERP can diverge from the platform defaults in precisely the ways they need, without affecting other tenants and without preventing them from receiving platform upgrades.

## 1.4 Key Value Propositions

### 1.4.1 One Backend, Many Surfaces

A single backend UI definition drives all client surfaces — web browser, iOS application, Android application, and any future surface (voice assistant, industrial terminal, embedded widget, AR overlay). The business logic, permissions, and UI intent are expressed once. Each surface renders that intent using its native capabilities.

This is not a compromise model where platforms are forced to share a lowest-common-denominator interface. The UI definition system is expressive enough that mobile clients can render native date pickers, sheet navigators, and haptic interactions — while web clients render the same underlying definition using browser-native controls, CSS grid layouts, and keyboard navigation patterns. The **definition is shared; the rendering is platform-native**.

### 1.4.2 Business Logic Drives UI, Not the Inverse

In conventional frontend architectures, business logic and UI logic are entangled. A component knows not only how to render itself but also when it should be visible, what values it should accept, and what should happen when the user interacts with it. This entanglement makes the frontend difficult to test, difficult to change, and prone to drift from backend truth.

In AwoERP, the backend expresses UI intent — field visibility, validation rules, action permissions, workflow states — as data. The frontend receives that data and renders it. Business logic does not leak into rendering engines. Rendering engines do not re-implement business logic. The separation is structural, not aspirational.

### 1.4.3 ERP-Native Component Vocabulary

General-purpose UI frameworks offer components appropriate for general-purpose applications: buttons, text inputs, modal dialogs, data tables. ERP applications require a richer vocabulary: multi-currency amount inputs, GL account selectors, approval action bars, line-item grids with tax breakdowns, audit trails, document attachment viewers, and workflow progress indicators.

AwoERP's component system is designed for the ERP domain. The component library is not a generic component system adapted for ERP — it is an ERP component system, built from the vocabulary of finance, procurement, inventory, HR, and sales. This means that a backend engineer composing a purchase order form uses `PurchaseOrderHeader`, `LineItemGrid`, `VendorCard`, and `ApprovalActionBar` — not `div`, `input`, `table`, and `button`.

### 1.4.4 Permission-Aware UI at the Source

In most systems, authorization is enforced at the API layer. The frontend independently decides which elements to show or hide, based on the user's role or permissions — a decision that is made in frontend code, duplicated from the backend's authorization model, and always at risk of divergence.

In AwoERP, the UI compilation pipeline integrates with the platform's authorization system (OpenFGA / Casbin) before the UI definition leaves the backend. Fields the user is not permitted to see are removed from the payload. Actions the user is not permitted to execute are absent from the definition. Navigation items the user cannot access are not included in the menu structure.

The frontend never receives a UI definition containing elements it should hide. **The hiding happens at the source.** The frontend renders exactly what it receives, and what it receives is already correct for the user's authorization context.
